# OmniAgent Delivery — Deployment, Discord, and Gateway Hardening — Roadmap

**Initiative:** `INIT-OMNIAGENT-001`
**Repository:** `github.com/plexusone/omniagent`
**Status:** Executing — 27 of 34 items completed

> RMI IDs are stable and permanent. Commits implementing an item carry the trailer `Refs: RMI-OMNIAGENT-<NNN>`. Phase status is derived from member RMIs — a phase is complete only when all its required RMIs are complete.

## Phase 1 — Cloud Deployment

**Theme:** Ship OmniAgent as a Discord bot on AWS Lightsail via omnideploy from a public GHCR image.
**Status:** Complete — 5 of 5 items completed

- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-001` Discord 2000-character message chunking in omnichat
  - - Acceptance: replies over 2000 chars split into multiple messages; rune-based, breaks on paragraph/newline/space; shipped as omnichat v0.8.1 and linked into the omniagent binary
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-002` Standalone multi-stage Dockerfile for omniagent
  - - Acceptance: `docker build --platform linux/amd64` succeeds with no local replace mounts; runs `gateway run`; serves `/health`
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-003` Publish container image to GHCR (public)
  - Depends on: `RMI-OMNIAGENT-002`
  - - Shipped: `.github/workflows/docker.yaml` builds and pushes `ghcr.io/plexusone/omniagent` on `v*` tag push (`:vX.Y.Z`, `:X.Y`, `:latest`), or `:smoke` via manual `workflow_dispatch`. `docs/guides/deployment.md` corrected to describe the actual tag-triggered behavior instead of "any push." One manual one-time step remains outside CI's reach: an admin must set the GHCR package visibility to Public after the first push (already documented in the guide's "GHCR Authentication" section) — `GITHUB_TOKEN` can't do this itself.
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-004` Lightsail deployment via omnideploy
  - Depends on: `RMI-OMNIAGENT-003`
  - - Acceptance: `omnideploy up --target lightsail --backend pulumi` provisions a running service with the Discord/agent/Serper env
  - - Shipped: `omniagent-discord` container service ACTIVE in `us-west-2` (micro, deployment v2) at its Lightsail HTTPS URL, deployed via `omnideploy up` with a least-privilege IAM profile (`lightsail:*` + SSM scoped to `/omniagent/*`) and a local-file Pulumi backend. The first deployment (v1) failed and led to three product fixes: a slog/log bridge cycle that deadlocked every CLI run before its first log line (`0908a72`), a `/api/health` route that container health checks probed but the gateway never served (`a24f5d2`), and a `temperature: 0.7` default that newer Claude models reject outright (`4fef85a`). Also switched the target region to `us-west-2` (identical Lightsail pricing, smaller incident blast radius than `us-east-1`) and enabled the embedded web UI + personal-mode auth over the public endpoint (`f15c431`, `0abcb4c`).
  - - Prep done, not yet run (needs AWS credentials this session doesn't have): `deploy/lightsail/deploy.yaml` written for the `omnideploy` "omniagent" runtime adapter. Also fixed the Dockerfile's `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD` split — LightSail's `command` field maps to Docker `CMD` (appended to `ENTRYPOINT`, not a replacement), so the adapter's hardcoded `Args: ["gateway", "run"]` would have doubled up against an all-in-`ENTRYPOINT` image. Three bugs found and fixed **in `omnideploy` itself** while verifying this against its actual source (not just its docs): `${VAR}`/`${VAR:-default}` expansion was documented but never implemented anywhere in the module (`bfea43f`); adapter auto-detection iterated a Go map in nondeterministic order, so an ambiguously-named config could resolve to the wrong adapter from run to run (`04040a7`); and `agent.api_key: ${VAR}` converts to a `SecretRef` the Lightsail/Pulumi backend never actually reads (still open — this is exactly `RMI-OMNIAGENT-006`'s scope), worked around here by setting secrets via `deploy.environment` directly instead.
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-005` Deployment smoke test on Lightsail
  - Depends on: `RMI-OMNIAGENT-004`
  - - Acceptance: `/health` green; a Discord message triggers a chunked reply; `web_search` (Serper) returns current results
  - - Shipped: against the live service — `/health` and `/api/health` 200; SPA served over Lightsail TLS; `/api/capabilities` reports `authRequired`; unauthenticated `/api/chat` rejected 401; full magic-link login round-trip (request → link from container log → verify → session cookie → authenticated chat 200); container log confirms `discord bot connected` and gateway bound on `0.0.0.0:8080`.

## Phase 2 — Deployment Hardening

**Theme:** Make the deployment production-safe: secrets, durable storage, and CI-buildable images.
**Status:** In progress — 4 of 5 items completed

- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-006` SSM-backed secret injection in omnideploy Lightsail target
  - - Acceptance: `SecretRef` (`ssm:`/`secretsmanager:`) resolved and injected; secrets never land in plaintext env or Pulumi state (schema exists; target does not yet consume `cfg.Secrets`)
  - - Shipped (in `omnideploy`, three commits): a `secrets` resolver package (`env:`/`ssm:` SecureString/`secretsmanager:` sources, every ref must resolve non-empty so a missing secret fails the deploy up front), wired into the Pulumi backend's `Apply`/`Preview` with resolved values injected via `pulumi.ToSecret` (encrypted in state — verified zero plaintext occurrences in the live state file), plus a `deploy.secrets` pass-through in the omniagent adapter. This repo's `deploy/lightsail/deploy.yaml` now sources all three secrets from `ssm:/omniagent/*`; the deploying shell needs no secret env vars at all (verified with them explicitly unset). Documented ceiling: Lightsail has no task IAM roles or native secret refs, so resolved values remain console-visible container env vars — full runtime injection arrives with an ECS target. Rotation = update the SSM parameter, rerun `omnideploy up`.
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-007` Durable session/cron storage on Lightsail
  - - Acceptance: session and cron state survive a redeploy (Lightsail Container Service has no volumes; SQLite at `STORAGE_PATH` is ephemeral)
  - - Shipped: config-driven `storage.type` (`sqlite`/`redis`/`memory`) + `sessions.enabled`/`sessions.ttl`, matching the surface `docs/reference/configuration.md` had documented as "planned"; `gateway run` now builds the backend and wires `agent.WithStorage`/`WithSessionStore` for every agent, and `agent.WithCronScheduler()` for the single-agent path (multi-agent mode skips it — one shared job store, one scheduler, avoids duplicate firing). Also fixed a real gap found in the process: `gateway/handlers.go`'s Discord/WebSocket chat path called the stateless `Process` unconditionally despite a "conversation continuity" comment — it now dispatches to `ProcessWithSession` via a new `gateway.SessionAwareProcessor` capability check whenever a session store is configured, so persisted history is actually used, not just stored.
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-008` Single-replica gateway guard
  - - Acceptance: gateway mode enforces or documents `replicas == 1` (one Discord WebSocket; extra replicas double-answer)
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-009` Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
  - - Acceptance: signal handler cancels context and runs `router.DisconnectAll` on shutdown (implemented in `cmd/omniagent/commands/gateway.go`)
- [ ] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-010` CI-buildable grokify-omniagent image
  - - Acceptance: grokify-omniagent builds in CI without local `replace` mounts (vendor or publish the 11 replaced deps)

## Phase 3 — Discord Channel Completeness

**Theme:** Close the documented-but-unimplemented Discord gaps (work lands in omnichat/providers/discord).
**Status:** Planned — 0 of 5 items completed

- [ ] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-011` Discord media send
  - - Acceptance: `Send` builds `discordgo.MessageSend` `Files`/`Embeds` from `OutgoingMessage.Media` (currently only `Content` is set)
- [ ] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-012` Discord media receive
  - - Acceptance: `convertIncoming` maps `m.Attachments` to `IncomingMessage.Media`
- [ ] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-013` Discord slash commands
  - - Acceptance: `ApplicationCommand` registration + `InteractionCreate` handler
- [ ] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-014` Discord HTTP interactions with Ed25519 verification
  - - Acceptance: webhook endpoint verifies `X-Signature-Ed25519`; usable as an alternative to gateway mode
- [ ] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-015` guildID enforcement and message events
  - - Acceptance: configured `guildID` is enforced (currently stored but unused); reaction/edit/delete events mapped

## Phase 4 — Gateway Security and Observability

**Theme:** Harden the gateway control plane and add production observability.
**Status:** Complete — 5 of 5 items completed

- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-016` WebSocket origin checking
  - - Acceptance: `CheckOrigin` enforces an allowlist (currently returns `true` with a `// TODO` in `gateway/gateway.go`)
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-017` Gateway WebSocket authentication
  - - Acceptance: real auth on `/ws` (the `handleAuth` handler currently accepts all requests via a `// TODO` stub)
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-018` Per-sender rate limiting
  - - Acceptance: message-processing path rate-limits per sender/channel
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-019` Observability tracing hook
  - - Acceptance: `ObservabilityHook` (omniobserve/llmops) applied to the agent in `gateway run`; slog/langfuse providers available (Opik provider is a follow-on)
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-020` Prometheus metrics endpoint
  - - Acceptance: `/metrics` exposes gateway/agent metrics for scraping

## Phase 5 — Test Coverage

**Theme:** Increase test coverage for critical low-coverage packages.
**Status:** Complete — 5 of 5 items completed

- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-021` Agent package test coverage (target: 50%+)
  - - Acceptance: `agent` package coverage increases from 7% to 50%+; covers core Process flow, tool execution, session handling
  - - Shipped: 37.5% → 91.6%. Covers the full tool-call loop, session persistence on success/mid-turn error, hooks/profile/role/skill-manager wiring, and the remaining functional options. `Agent.GetSession`'s doc comment (previously claimed it returns nil for a missing session; it actually returns `sessions.ErrSessionNotFound`) has been corrected.
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-022` OpenAI API server test coverage (target: 50%+)
  - - Acceptance: `api/openai` package coverage increases from 15.6% to 50%+; covers streaming, models endpoint, tool listing
  - - Shipped: 18.2% → 66.9%. Covers SSE streaming end-to-end, models list/retrieve with API-key auth, ogen<->internal type conversions, usage/tool-usage stores. **Security fix, found in the process:** `POST /openai/v1/chat/completions` bypassed `securityHandler`/API-key auth entirely — `StreamingHandler.ServeHTTP` (`streaming.go`) never called into the ogen-wrapped, auth-checked handler for POST requests, unlike `/models`. Fixed by applying the same `securityHandler.HandleBearerAuth` check directly in `StreamingHandler.ServeHTTP` before dispatch, with regression tests locking in both the rejection and the open-when-unconfigured cases.
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-023` OpenAI adapter test coverage (target: 50%+)
  - - Acceptance: `openai` adapter package coverage increases from 19.9% to 50%+; covers multi-agent routing, chat completion, cron handler
  - - Shipped: 19.9% → 91.4%. Covers routing precedence, the `useSession` gate, streaming reassembly, and the cron handler end-to-end against a real in-memory scheduler; a shared httptest-backed fake LLM drives a real `*agent.Agent` with no network access.
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-024` Voice package test coverage (target: 50%+)
  - - Acceptance: `voice` package coverage increases from 22.6% to 50%+; covers gateway, processor, providers
  - - Shipped: 22.6% → 96.2%. Covers the Gateway's call/session lifecycle and `ProcessWithAgent`, `NewGateway`'s provider/credential resolution (Twilio/Telnyx, error paths), and tool/handler conversion — fakes for the voice gateway/session/LLM provider drive real request marshaling with zero network I/O.
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-025` Skills package test coverage (target: 50%+)
  - - Acceptance: `skills` package coverage increases from 37.8% to 50%+; covers skill loading, execution, validation
  - - Shipped: 41.2% → 96.7%. Covers discovery/loading (directory + embedded-pack sources, dedup precedence, malformed manifests), the `Manager` (Load/Get/All/Count/Available, Includes/Excludes ordering), and `CheckRequirements` install-hint formatting.

## Phase 6 — Context and Token Management

**Theme:** Implement the deferred context window and token counting features.
**Status:** Complete — 5 of 5 items completed

- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-026` Model-specific token counting
  - - Acceptance: `ModelTokenCounter` uses tiktoken for OpenAI models, provider-specific counting for Anthropic/others; accurate to within 5% of actual usage
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-027` LLM-based conversation summarization
  - - Acceptance: `WindowStrategySummarize` calls LLM to summarize older messages; configurable summarization prompt; summary replaces N oldest messages
  - - Shipped: `Window.applySummarize` (previously a stub) now calls an injected `SummarizeFunc`, keeping the system message + most recent messages verbatim and replacing older ones with a single summary message; falls back to plain recency windowing and returns a `*CompactionError` if summarization fails or isn't configured. `Engine.Apply` gained a `ctx`/error-returning signature and delegates to `Window` internally when `CompactionEnabled`+`CompactionThreshold` are set (`Engine.EnableCompaction`), composing with its existing message/token windowing. `agent.WithCompaction(threshold)` wires this to the agent's own LLM client (`agent/compaction.go`'s `summarizeMessages`, configurable via `Config.CompactionPrompt`) — a pure library capability, matching RMI-026's precedent of no `gateway run`/CLI wiring.
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-028` Autoreply template rendering
  - - Acceptance: `autoreply` package template TODO implemented; supports variable substitution in auto-reply messages
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-029` WebSocket origin allowlist
  - - Acceptance: `CheckOrigin` in `gateway/gateway.go` enforces configurable allowlist; rejects requests from unlisted origins
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-030` Gateway WebSocket authentication
  - - Acceptance: `handleAuth` in `gateway/handlers.go` validates tokens/credentials; supports API key and JWT authentication

## Phase 7 — Reusable Public Image

**Theme:** Make the published container a deployment-agnostic, multi-arch, supply-chain-verified artifact usable beyond this repo's own deployments.
**Status:** In progress — 3 of 4 items completed
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-031` Full config injection via environment (`OMNIAGENT_CONFIG_B64`)
  - - Acceptance: entrypoint accepts a complete config file through a single env var (base64), closing the gap where nested config (team mode, per-skill config, vault bindings) is unreachable on platforms without volume mounts (Lightsail). The personal-mode web UI env vars (`OMNIAGENT_WEB_ENABLED`/`OMNIAGENT_AUTH_*`) shipped as the first installment; this generalizes it.
  - - Shipped: decoded in `config.LoadWithContext` itself rather than an entrypoint script — the payload never touches disk. Any base64 alphabet, padded or not; YAML or JSON. Precedence: explicit `--config` wins entirely; individual `OMNIAGENT_*` env vars override on top, matching file semantics. Documented with a keep-credentials-out caveat (the payload lands in platform-visible env; secrets stay in `deploy.secrets`/vault bindings).
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-032` Multi-arch image build (linux/arm64)
  - - Acceptance: `Docker Build & Publish` produces a linux/amd64 + linux/arm64 manifest so the public image runs on Graviton and Apple Silicon without emulation.
  - - Shipped: builder stage pinned to `BUILDPLATFORM` with `GOOS`/`GOARCH` from `TARGETOS`/`TARGETARCH` — the Go compile stays native (no QEMU) and, notably, this fixed a latent bug where the hardcoded `GOARCH=amd64` would have shipped amd64 binaries inside arm64 images. Verified on GHCR: the `:latest` index lists `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` image manifests.
- [ ] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-033` DockerHub mirror publish
  - - Acceptance: image mirrored to DockerHub for discoverability, gated on `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`/`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` repo secrets; GHCR remains canonical (DockerHub anonymous pulls are rate-limited).
- [x] `RMI-OMNIAGENT-034` SBOM and cosign signing on image publish
  - - Acceptance: the publish workflow emits an SBOM and signs the image with provenance attestation (cosign) — pre-announcement supply-chain requirement.
  - - Shipped: BuildKit `sbom: true` + `provenance: mode=max` attach SBOM and SLSA provenance attestation manifests to the pushed index (visible as the two `unknown/unknown` attestation entries), and keyless cosign signs the digest via the workflow's OIDC identity (`id-token: write`; cosign-installer pinned to exact `v4.1.2` — no floating major tag exists). Verified end-to-end with a local `cosign verify` against the Fulcio CA and Rekor transparency log. Note: cosign v3 pushes the signature in bundle format under a bare `sha256-<digest>` tag (GHCR lacks the OCI referrers API, so the tag fallback is used — there is no `.sig` suffix anymore).
