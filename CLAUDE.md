# CLAUDE.md — omniagent

Project-specific guidance for Claude Code. This complements the global
(`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) and plexusone org (`~/go/src/github.com/plexusone/.github/CLAUDE.md`)
instructions — follow those too (Ent, Cobra, official MCP Go SDK, library-first,
specs-before-implementation, `Refs: RMI-…` commit trailers, verify dependency
versions).

## What this is

OmniAgent is an AI agent that routes messages across channels (Telegram,
Discord, WhatsApp, Twilio, …), an OpenAI-compatible API, a WebSocket gateway,
and an embedded web UI. It runs in two shapes:

- **Personal mode** (default): one implicit user, SQLite, a single agent.
- **Team mode** (`team.enabled`): many users, PostgreSQL with row-level
  security, magic-link/email+password/Google/GitHub auth, an admin UI,
  private/group chats, and **virtual agents** with a catalog. See
  `docs/guides/team-mode.md`, `docs/guides/team-deployment.md`, and
  `docs/guides/agents.md`.

## Package map

| Path | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `agent/` | Core agent: config, options, tools, compiled-skill registration, session rollover. `agent.New` builds one instance. |
| `marketplace/` | Reusable agent/skill marketplace primitives for host apps: portable listings, filters, provider interface, static provider, and adapters from `agent/registry` + `skills`. Keep app-specific capabilities as strings owned by the host app rather than hardcoding UIForge/OmniRoadmap policy here. |
| `gateway/` | WebSocket gateway + all HTTP handlers. `team_http.go` (auth incl. SSO + password login, admin allowlist/users/secret-bindings, `RequireAuth`/CSRF middleware), `team_chat_http.go` (chats), `agents_http.go` (virtual-agents API), `web_http.go` (SPA + capabilities), `translate_http.go` (one-shot composer translate). `handlers.go`'s chat path dispatches to `ProcessWithSession` instead of the stateless `Process` whenever the agent satisfies `SessionAwareProcessor` (`gateway.go`) and has a configured session store — a type-assertion capability check, same pattern as `SessionToolConfigurator`/`SessionModelConfigurator`. |
| `team/` | Multi-user domain. `auth/` (magic-link + email+password (argon2id) + Google OIDC/GitHub OAuth SSO + Principal — `CompleteSSOLogin` resolves/links a provider identity by verified email, reusing the same session issuance as magic-link), `agents/` (virtual-agents service: CRUD, roles, `Can` authz matrix, registry, catalog), `chats/` (DMs/groups, agent turns, mention policy, memory scope), `secrets/` (ScopedVault multi-tenancy + per-agent secret resolution over OmniVault — `Service.ResolveAgentSecrets`), `agentruntime/` (lazy bounded per-agent runtime cache + builder; `SecretSource` also carries the agent's enabled-skill list so config-binding fallback stays skill-scoped), `store/` (Ent + RLS, dialect-aware), `ent/` (generated), `mail/`. |
| `skills/` | `compiled/` (Go skill interface + `StorageAware`/`AgentAware`/`SecretsAware`/`SecretRequirer` injection), `remote/mcp/` (MCP subprocess skill), `remote/openapi/` (OpenAPI 3.x skill, `Auth.{APIKeyEnv,TokenEnv,PasswordEnv}` secret injection), `web/`, `memory/`, `github/`. |
| `config/` | Config structs + validation. `credentials.go` (vault URI resolution — `op://`/`bw://`/`file://`/`env://` — for infra credentials and the `Secrets`/`Skills.Config[name].Secrets` bindings), `team.go` (team + secrets + SSO/password provider credentials), `capabilities.go` (web-UI capability flags incl. `translate`), `storage.go` (`storage.type`/`sessions.*` — `StorageConfig.Validate()`, `DefaultStoragePath()`). |
| `internal/redact/` | Process-wide registry of resolved secret values + an `slog.Handler` wrapper that masks them out of log output; wrapped over the CLI's default logger in `cmd/.../root.go`. |
| `web/dist/` | Embedded vanilla-JS SPA (`app.js`, `style.css`) — no build step, CSP-clean (no external assets), persistent left-nav shell (`#shell`>`#sidenav`+`#app`). |
| `cmd/omniagent/commands/` | Cobra CLI + composition root. `gateway.go` mounts handlers, builds the `storage.*`-selected `kvs.Store` (`storage.go`'s `buildStorageBackend`) and wires it into every agent via `agent.WithStorage`/`WithSessionStore`, starting `agent.WithCronScheduler()` only in single-agent mode (`len(cfg.Agents) == 0`) since multiple schedulers on one shared job store would double-fire; `team.go` (`setupTeamMode`) wires the team services, incl. `mergeSecretEnv`'s 3-tier secret precedence and `globalSecretBindings`'s admin snapshot. `healthcheck.go` is a dependency-free `omniagent healthcheck` subcommand (no config load, no credential resolution) that HTTP-probes the running gateway's own `/health` — it exists because the shell-less runtime image (see Container base image below) has no wget/curl for a Dockerfile `HEALTHCHECK` to shell out to. |
| `docs/specs/initiatives/` | Initiative specs + ROADMAPs (`INIT-OMNIAGENT-00N`). |

## Team-mode architecture (important patterns)

- **Two-layer authorization.** The service layer is the *primary* gate
  (`agents.Service.Can` / `requireEditor` / `requireOwner`, `chats` membership
  checks); PostgreSQL **RLS is a defense-in-depth backstop**. On the SQLite path
  there are no policies, so service-layer checks must stand alone — write tests
  accordingly (a SQLite test cannot assert RLS read-visibility; assert the
  capability gate and mutations instead).
- **System vs. user context.** Authorization *facts* are read via
  `store.AsSystem` (not filtered by RLS) so a decision doesn't depend on
  visibility; data operations run via `store.AsUser(userID, superadmin, …)`.
- **HTTP handler shape.** Each surface is an `XxxHTTP` struct owning its own
  `*http.ServeMux` built in `routes()` (Go 1.22 method+wildcard patterns),
  exposing `Handler()`. Mounted from `cmd/.../gateway.go` via `gw.Handle(...)`,
  wrapped in `teamHTTP.RequireAuth`. Mutations require the `X-OmniAgent-CSRF`
  header (`actorCSRF` helper); read the principal with `principalFrom(ctx)`.
  ServeMux longest-pattern-wins is relied on (exact `/api/capabilities` beats the
  `/api/` subtree).
- **Per-agent runtime.** `agentruntime.Cache` builds an agent's instance lazily
  on first turn (persona + enabled skills + agent-scoped secrets) and holds it in
  a bounded LRU. It depends only on seams (`ConfigLoader`, `Builder`,
  `SecretSource`); adapters live at the composition root so packages stay
  decoupled.
- **Agent-scoped secrets.** `team/secrets.ScopedVault` namespaces an OmniVault
  store per agent (`agents/<id>/…`); isolation is structural (a scoped caller
  cannot address another namespace). Injection flows through
  `compiled.SecretsAware`/`agent.WithSecretEnv`, gated by
  `compiled.SecretRequirer`/markdown `Skill.UnmetRequiredSecrets` (an unmet
  *required* secret excludes the skill instead of failing later). Precedence
  when a config binding also exists: per-agent secret then per-skill config
  binding (scoped to that agent's own enabled skills) then global config
  binding — `cmd/omniagent/commands/team.go`'s `mergeSecretEnv`. `memory`/`file`
  providers are not encrypted at rest yet.
- **Secret redaction.** Every resolved secret value (vault-backed or a plain
  config literal) is registered with `internal/redact` at the point it's
  resolved (`config.resolveCredential`, `team/secrets.Service.ResolveAgentSecrets`)
  so it's masked out of all log output for the process's lifetime — a
  defense-in-depth backstop on top of injection paths never intentionally
  logging a value. Register any *new* secret-resolution call site the same
  way; don't rely solely on "nothing logs it today."

## Build / test / lint

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin
go build ./...                 # package-scoped is faster on a cold cache
go test ./...                  # most team/gateway tests SKIP without Postgres — see below
golangci-lint run
node --check web/dist/app.js   # the SPA has no build step; syntax-check it
```

- `go build ./...` can be slow cold — prefer package-scoped builds while iterating.
- gopls "No active builds contain …" diagnostics on new/edited files are LSP
  workspace noise; verify with real `go build`/`go test`/`golangci-lint`.
- **Most `team/`, `team/auth/`, and `gateway/` tests are Postgres-backed**
  (`internal/pgtest.DSNs`, RLS-heavy) and silently `t.Skip` without
  `TEAM_TEST_OWNER_DSN`/`TEAM_TEST_APP_DSN` — a pass with them skipped is
  not real coverage. Point those two env vars at a real dev Postgres (see
  `deploy/team/dev/docker-compose.dev.yaml`), or a scratch local `initdb`
  instance, before trusting `go test ./team/... ./gateway/...` results;
  only `team/store` and `team/agents` have SQLite-only test paths.

## Conventions specific to this repo

- **Never read secret files** (`.env*`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`) —
  load them in Bash via `source`/`export`; check existence with `ls`/`test -f`.
- **Commit only when asked or when implementing an authorized RMI**; **never push
  unless explicitly asked.** Atomic topical commits (core → tests → docs) with
  `Refs: RMI-OMNIAGENT-<NNN>` trailers.
- Keep the SPA self-contained: inline all CSS/JS, no external/CDN assets (guarded
  by `web/embed_test.go`); set user text via `textContent`, never `innerHTML`.
- After major work, keep VisionStudio RMI/phase/initiative status in sync.
- **Container base image is Chainguard static** (`Dockerfile`'s runtime stage,
  digest-pinned) per the PlexusOne container base-image policy: no shell, no
  package manager, no libc. Don't propose `apk add`/`wget`/shell-based fixes
  for the runtime image — probe HTTP from inside the container via the
  `omniagent healthcheck` subcommand, not `wget`/`curl`. tzdata is embedded at
  build time via `-tags timetzdata`, not an OS package.
